# Sentient Villagers
 Dynamic, LLM-powered NPCs in Minecraft that can socially interact with one another, form societies, and more!

Each agent has a memory that stores information that they observe. Agents conduct higher level reflections on top of memories for more high-level memories. For each observation, memory is given as context to the interaction to determine various things about it such as what to respond with, what action to conduct, or to even engage at all.

 Memory architecture inspired by "Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior" paper by Stanford University.
